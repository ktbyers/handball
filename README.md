### Official Handball Ball
- This is a green, bouncy kickball that is eight to twelve inches in diameter.

### Serving
- The ball must bounce once on each square in the diagram.
- If the serve doesn't bounce once on each square, then it is a fault and the server must execute a second serve.
- If you have a fault on your second serve, your opponent gets a point.
- If you are ten or under, then you get infinite second serves.
- You must hit the ball with your hand (overhand) when serving. You can not bowl it underhand.

### Scoring Points
- You can score points both when serving and returning.
- You score a point by hitting the ball into the opponents square and having it bounce twice or by your opponent not returning it into the court.
- You also score a point by hitting the ball to the opponent and having them try to return it and not succeed (or by having the ball hit them).
- The opponent must hit their return using their hands.
- If you are ten or under, then any return including off hands, knees, head, chest, feet is valid.

### Winning the Game
- The first person to ten points wins the game.
- If there is a person on your team that is ten or under, then you get three redos that can be executed at any point during the game.

### Tips
- It is good to use your redos at the end of the game if you really need them.
- If you want a challenge, it is good to use a bouncy ball.
- Rushing the net is a good strategy.
- Dads should not hit shots overhead.
- Drop shots are awesome.
