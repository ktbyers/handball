### Serving
- The ball must bounce once on each square in the diagram.
- If the serve doesn't bounce once on each square, then it is a fault and the server must execute a second serve.
- If you have a fault on your second serve, your opponent gets a point.
- If you are ten or under, then you get infinite second serves.

### Scoring points
- You can score points both when serving and returning.
- You score a point by hitting the ball into the opponents square and having it bounce twice or by your opponent not returning it into the court.
- You also score a point by hitting the ball to the opponent and having them try to return it and not succeed (or by having the ball hit them).
- The opponent must hit their return using their hands.
- If you are ten or under, then any return including off hands, knees, head, chest, feet is valid.
